Lab #1 was a collaboration between Ravi Niteesh (Technical Director) and Tony Wan (Creative Director)

# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview

## Part A. Plan 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

_Setting:_ The interaction with the device would be in an office setting. The interactive device is capable of facial recognition, primarily emotions. When the user is upset, it would display a red light signaling others to not disturb the person. When the user is happy, it would display a green light signaling others that it is okay to come in.

_Players:_ The user is the primary person to interact with the device, while the light signals are there for everyone else considering to walk into the users office

_Activity:_ Imagine the user is a manager having a rough day at work. The device would recognize the sad facial expression and display a red light signaling to others that it is not a great time to be disturbed. On the other end of the spectrum, the manager is very happy and the device recognizes a happy facial expression and displays a green light, indicating that it is a good time to come in. 

_Goals:_ The goal of the user is to appropriately signal to others whether or not it is a good time to enter. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

![Mpath Storyboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111993874/187286818-778fd870-329e-4182-be2f-722d69c9636d.jpg)



\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

1. Costs for facial recognition device may deter consumers from purchasing. Users can opt for a switch like option.
2. Would like to see an option to change the entire room's lighting to help improve mood.


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

  Yes, facial recognition can be quite finicky and not always pick up subtle facial expressions.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

  Yes, for new itereations, we can include audio (music output) based on preset playlists depending on different moods. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Instructions were clear for setting up server and phone. Running tinkerbelle was quite easy considering my minimal coding background. 


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*


## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

![Untitled Notebook (5)-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111993874/187345097-23142e7d-a340-44f7-867e-451cdcf7972e.jpg)
![Untitled Notebook (5)-6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111993874/187345111-a70b620e-6bec-4404-931e-0ea34b240fc7.jpg)
![Untitled Notebook (5)-7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111993874/187345117-4be05227-f7a2-4942-af40-3c894e9827ef.jpg)

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

Since camera is required for facial recognition, privacy issues can be of concern. In the office setting, it would be easier to seamlessly incorporate into existing decor. As for the home setting, there is already a high rate of adoption for Amazon and Google home devices. Incorporating our prototype into familiar products would be quite easy. 


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

Should this be shared on a different platform?

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.

## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
